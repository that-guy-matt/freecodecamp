# Jack London Tribute Page

This is a tribute page to the author Jack London.

## General info

This web page was the first project for [Freecodecamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org). The original requirements for the project can be viewed [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

I designed and coded this website from scratch. Beyond the requirements and the given example, I used no other tutorial or guide.

I opted not to use a framework such as Bootstrap specifically for the purpose of challenging myself to learn and understand CSS Flexbox usage.

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* SCSS

## Project Status

This is a finished project. At this point I have no intentions to add to or change this project.
