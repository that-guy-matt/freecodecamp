          <p>Jack London (January 12, 1876 - November 22, 1916) was an American novelist, journalist, and social activist. He was one of the first writers to become a worldwide celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing.</p>

          <p>London was part of the radical literary group "The Crowd" in San Francisco and a passionate advocate of unionization, socialism, and the rights of workers. He wrote several powerful works dealing with these topics, such as his dystopian novel <cite>The Iron Heel</cite> and his non-fiction expose <cite>The People of the Abyss</cite>, and <cite>The War of the Classes</cite>.</p>

          <p>After winning first prize in a creative writing contest, London decided to pursue writing. He attended one semester at the University of California, Berkeley on borrowed money. After the first semester London dropped out due to financial struggles and later continued to pursue writing professionally.</p>

          <p>His most well known works include <cite>The Call of the Wile</cite> and <cite>White Fang</cite> as well as the short stories <cite>To Build a Fire</cite>, <cite>An Odyssey of the North</cite> and <cite>Love of Life</cite>.</p>

        <h2>Jack London State Park</h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <p>London's writing career eventually became tedius to him, he later described it as more of a chore to pay the bills than a true passion. He developed and pursued a passion for sustainable farming, well before it's time. He purchased a winery on a large plot of land in Glen Ellen, California and proceeded to conduct experiments in sustainable farming until his untimely death in 1916.</p>

          <p>Jack London's Glen Ellen ranch is now a state park and can be visited. His cottage on the ranch can be viewed as well as some examples of his farming experiments and the ruined remains of a mansion he had built.
